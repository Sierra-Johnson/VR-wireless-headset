## Pitch

-   Virtual reality headsets allow a person to be transported to a different realityâ€¦ that is, until they land (hard) back in the real world thanks to unwieldly cords attached to the VR helmet. Similar to the Occulus Quest 2, our project addresses the problem of extraneous cords used with traditional, wired VR headsets by removing said cords in order to create a wireless headset that allows the user to move freely in their environment. Our prototype of a helmet-based headset uniquely distributes the additional weight of battery packs, computers, etc. in order to give a simpler, more comfortable experience that what is on the market today. 


## History

-   VR headsets are rapidly making improvements, but the one major flaw still seen regularly is the need for a direct connection from the VR headset to a computer in order to run its software. When a person puts on a VR headset, they completely lose their sight in the real world, creating scenarios that can likely have disastrous outcomes. Our team has heard and personally encountered scenarios of accidents caused by tripping/ getting wrapped in cords while using VR, so we decided that making a wireless headset would be a relevant project for us in particular to pursue. We believe that *wireless* headsets are an integral next-step for all VR headsets to adapt in order to be safer and more convenient for the consumer.

## Features
-   2-3 hours of wireless usage
- Includes audio port access  
-  Screen and computing hardware can be detached and used as a regular computer, before reattaching to the optical viewing port
- Additional weight distribution thanks to our helmet-configured headmount design

## About

### The Development Team
  - Our origin story:
	  - We are three, senior Computer Science majors at the University of Utah. Having all taken various classes together over the past 4 years, this helped us not only be aware of our individual strengths and weaknesses, but also get to know each other as friends outside of the classroom. Each of us has enjoyed owning a VR headset at some point in time, so it was no wonder when we walked into class the first day and saw each other!
