# Final Project: Writeup

## Factsheet
1. Team Name: **Wireless Experience**
Team members: **Alexandra Neubauer, Sierra Johnson, Alex Carpentieri**
Location: **Salt Lake City, UT, United States**
3. Release Date: **December 13th, 2021**
4. Platforms: TODO Arduino, Raspberry Pi, LED Screen, 
4. Website: https://github.com/Sierra-Johnson/VR-wireless-headset


## Pitch

-   Virtual reality headsets can take the user to another immersive world… that is, until they get tangled up in their cords. Similar to the Occulus Quest 2, our project addresses the problem of extraneous cords with traditional, wired VR headsets and removes said cords in order to create a wireless headset that allows the user to move freely in their environment. Our use of a helmet-based headset helps distribute the additional weight of battery packs and the like in order to give a simpler, more comfortable experience that what is on the market today. TODO (do we want stuff about the helmet?)


## History

-   VR headsets are rapidly making improvements, but the one caveat still seen regularly is the need to connect the VR headset to a computer in order to run their software. While there are some headsets such as the Occulus Quest 2 that are now wireless, we still believe this to be an integral next-step for all VR headsets in the future.Our team has heard and personally encountered many stories of nearly getting hurt tripping over cords connected to the VR headset, so we decided that making a wireless headset would be a relevant project for us in particular to pursue.
    

-   (How did it come about??? why this project? whynow TODO)
    

## Features
-   2-3 hours of wireless usage
- Includes audio port access  
-   Screen and computing hardware can be detached and used as a regular computer, before reattaching to the optical viewing port
- (Additional features for helmet prototype)
  - Surround sound
-   (TODO BELOW THIS WANT??) Uploaded VR software to a Raspberry Pi
    
-   Secured a Raspberry-pi to the screen
    
-   Mounted the wireless battery pack to the headset

## About

### The Development Team
  - Our origin story:
	  - We are three senior computer science majors at the University of Utah. After taking many classes together, we were already aware of each of our strengths and weaknesses
    
  -   If you worked on a team: how did y’all get together?
    
  -   If y’all can and want: a picture of the team would be great and makes people smile

### Credits
    

   Who worked on what? You can take this as seriously or as not seriously as you’d like, but please be honest about what each person primarily contributed to on the project. If you are unsure how to credit people, a resource I recommend looking at is the Game Crediting Guide (v 9.2) of the International Game Developers Association. Last I checked, the guide is available here: https://igda.org/resources-archive/crediting-standards-guide-ver-9-2-en-jp-2014/.
